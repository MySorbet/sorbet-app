1. Take a look at README.md to understand this repository's structure, history, guidelines, and more.

2. Take a look at the existing components and stories to understand the codebase.

3. Use the most modern React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS features. Avoid using older features, patterns, and syntax when you have a modern alternative.

4. When importing components or suggesting autocompletes for imports, prefer local imports if they are within 3 directories (i.e. `../../../components`). Follow `@` imports that you see elsewhere in the codebase (i.e. `@/components`, `@/lib`, etc.).

5. When adding or autocompleting tsdoc / jsdoc for props of react components or their interfaces, try to keep the comment on a single line like so:

```
  /** Callback indicating the user wants to get verified */
```

5. When creating a new component or story, always use kebab case for the file name. Usually, components are the upper camel case version of their file name.

6. When creating a new component, always create a story for it.

7. When writing stories, always use CSF format. Define meta as a const and use TS satisfies. Define a local typ `Story` as use to type all named exports.

8. When writing stories, always use fn() from `@storybook/test` rather than alert(), console.log, or an empty function.
   
9.  When writing stories, the default export should be `export const Default: Story = {};` if the component has no props. If it does have props, add the appropriate args for the default case.

10. Prefer TS `satisfies` to `as`.
