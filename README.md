## ðŸ”¨ Development

### ðŸ”¥ Quickstart

Note: We use `corepack` to ensure everyone is using the same package manager. Before continuing, install it with `brew install corepack`.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/MySorbet/sorbet-app.git`.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to a new `.env` file and replace all secrets with those in [Google Secrets Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager?project=sorbet-production).
4. Start a hot reloading dev server with `yarn start:dev`.
